Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Most 3-axis MEMS sensors only offer a low noise \nprofile on two axes with the third axis (typically the Z or Vertical Radial Axis) having two to three times the noise density, \ncausing that third axis to have inaccurate data. This inaccurate data leads to maintenance decisions made without a true fault \npresent.\nAdjustable FMax Settings (VT3)\nThe vibration/temperature sensor has optional settings to increase the frequency resolution of the measurement through the \nadjustable FMax settings.\nAdjusting the FMax setting allows users to control the trade-off between frequency resolution, bandwidth, and measurement \nduration. Lower FMax settings provide finer frequency resolution but reduce the total bandwidth and increase the \nmeasurement time, whereas higher FMax settings broaden the frequency range but may sacrifice resolution. FMax is critical \nin vibration analysis because it determines the sensor's capability to detect and characterize different vibration frequencies, \nwhich is essential for diagnosing machinery health, identifying faults, and optimizing maintenance strategies. These options \nare changed in register 42058.\nFMax Options include:\n1 = 5300 Hz (3.29 Hz resolution, 300 ms sample duration)\n2 = 2650 Hz (1.65 Hz resolution, 610 ms sample duration)\n3 = 1300 Hz (0.82 Hz resolution, 1.215 seconds sample duration)\n4 = 650 Hz (0.41 Hz resolution, 2.43 seconds sample duration)\n5 = 325 Hz (0.21 Hz resolution, 4.86 seconds sample duration)\nConfiguring High-Frequency Enveloping (HFE) or \nDemodulation Mode\nHigh-frequency enveloping (HFE), or demodulation, is a separate measurement type and signal processing technique that is \nvery sensitive to high-frequency impacts and friction.\nHFE can be useful for diagnosing bearing defects, lubrication issues, cavitation, and gear faults. These types of faults \nproduce very low energy impacts/forces that can make them difficult to detect in their early stages with standard vibration \nmeasurements because they can be drowned out by the machine's fundamental forces. HFE mode trends the values to \ndetect early faults so maintenance can occur before a downtime event occurs. When paired with a lower FMax setting, the \nsample frequency still remains at maximum but the sensor takes a much longer sample. This data is used to trend early \ndefects on slow-speed assets that would normally require a special ultrasound accelerometer. When using HFE mode, set \nFmax to 3 or 4 for the longer 2.4-second or 4.8-second sample times. To enable HFE mode, set register 42059 value to 0 for \nOFF or 1 for ON.\n\nConfiguration InstructionsWireless MultiHop Q45 3-Axis Vibration and Temperature Radios\n23-Sep-25page 10 of 23 © Banner Engineering Corp.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Most 3-axis MEMS sensors only offer a low noise \nprofile on two axes with the third axis (typically the Z or Vertical Radial Axis) having two to three times the noise density, \ncausing that third axis to have inaccurate data. This inaccurate data leads to maintenance decisions made without a true fault \npresent.\nAdjustable FMax Settings (VT3)\nThe vibration/temperature sensor has optional settings to increase the frequency resolution of the measurement through the \nadjustable FMax settings.\nAdjusting the FMax setting allows users to control the trade-off between frequency resolution, bandwidth, and measurement \nduration. Lower FMax settings provide finer frequency resolution but reduce the total bandwidth and increase the \nmeasurement time, whereas higher FMax settings broaden the frequency range but may sacrifice resolution. FMax is critical \nin vibration analysis because it determines the sensor's capability to detect and characterize different vibration frequencies, \nwhich is essential for diagnosing machinery health, identifying faults, and optimizing maintenance strategies. These options \nare changed in register 42058.\nFMax Options include:\n1 = 5300 Hz (3.29 Hz resolution, 300 ms sample duration)\n2 = 2650 Hz (1.65 Hz resolution, 610 ms sample duration)\n3 = 1300 Hz (0.82 Hz resolution, 1.215 seconds sample duration)\n4 = 650 Hz (0.41 Hz resolution, 2.43 seconds sample duration)\n5 = 325 Hz (0.21 Hz resolution, 4.86 seconds sample duration)\nConfiguring High-Frequency Enveloping (HFE) or \nDemodulation Mode\nHigh-frequency enveloping (HFE), or demodulation, is a separate measurement type and signal processing technique that is \nvery sensitive to high-frequency impacts and friction.\nHFE can be useful for diagnosing bearing defects, lubrication issues, cavitation, and gear faults. These types of faults \nproduce very low energy impacts/forces that can make them difficult to detect in their early stages with standard vibration \nmeasurements because they can be drowned out by the machine's fundamental forces. HFE mode trends the values to \ndetect early faults so maintenance can occur before a downtime event occurs. When paired with a lower FMax setting, the \nsample frequency still remains at maximum but the sensor takes a much longer sample. This data is used to trend early \ndefects on slow-speed assets that would normally require a special ultrasound accelerometer. When using HFE mode, set \nFmax to 3 or 4 for the longer 2.4-second or 4.8-second sample times. To enable HFE mode, set register 42059 value to 0 for \nOFF or 1 for ON.\n\nConfiguration InstructionsWireless MultiHop Q45 3-Axis Vibration and Temperature Radios\n23-Sep-25page 10 of 23 © Banner Engineering Corp.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It is important to document the direction in which \neach axis is installed for labeling and diagnostic purposes.\nAn example install is to mount the sensor at the top center of a horizontally mounted motor with the X axis (parallel with the \nsensor cable) in line with the motor shaft or to mount the sensor with the Y axis (perpendicular to the sensor cable) \nperpendicular to the shaft in the horizontal radial axis and the Z axis (through plane of the sensor) going into or through the \nmotor in the vertical radial axis.\nFor the best results, install the sensor as close to the motor bearing as possible. If this is not possible, install the sensor on a \nsurface that is in rigid connection with the vibration characteristics of the motor.\nUsing a cover shroud or other flexible mounting location may result in a reduced accuracy or reduced ability to detect certain \nvibration characteristics. After determining the sensor direction and location, mount the sensor for the best possible vibration \nsensing accuracy.\nMounting Options QM30 Housing \nType Description\nBWA-QM30-FTAL (included \nwith the aluminum housing \nmodel)\nAluminum\nWhen available, directly mounting the bracket to the motor using an 1/4-28 × 1/2-inch screw \nprovides a rigid surface with the highest sensor accuracy and frequency response. This mounting \noption offers flexibility for future sensor and bracket movement.\nAnother mounting option is to use an epoxy to adhere the bracket to the motor. Banner recommends \nusing an epoxy designed for accelerometer mounting, such as Loctite Depend 330 and 7388 \nactivator.\nEpoxying a bracket to a motor provides a permanent installation of the bracket to which the sensor \ncan be attached. This more rigid mounting solution ensures some of the best sensor accuracy and \nfrequency response, but is not flexible for future adjustments.\nA third option is to use the included thermally conductive adhesive tape. This often provides a more \nthan sufficient mounting type but does introduce some additional flex that reduces accuracy.\nBWA-QM30-FTSS (included \nwith the stainless steel housing \nmodel)\nStainless steel\nBWA-QM30-CEAL (curved \nbracket epoxied to the motor) Aluminum\nThis lightweight aluminum bracket provides a close connection to the motor with ridges to sit on \ncurved surfaces and ensure a tight fit. The bracket is epoxied to the motor and the sensor is \nscrewed into the bracket.\nBWA-QM30-FMSS (flat magnet \nbracket)\nAluminum and \nstainless steel\nGives a solid, strong, and adjustable mount to a motor, but with a motor's curved surface it may not \nprovide the best connection if the motor is too small for the magnet to get a full connection with the \nmotor housing.\nMagnet mounts are susceptible to accident rotation or a change in the sensor location if an outside \nforce bumps or moves the sensor. This can lead to a change in sensor information that differs from \nthe time-trended data from the previous location.\nThe bracket is stainless steel and the magnet insert is neodymium.\nBWA-QM30-CMAL (curved \nsurface magnet bracket)\nAluminum and \nstainless steel\nGives a solid, strong, and adjustable mount to a motor, intended for use when the flat magnetic \nbracket does not make a good connection with the motor's surface.\nMagnet mounts are susceptible to accidental rotation or change in the sensor location if an outside \nforce bumps or moves the sensor. This can lead to a change in the sensor information that differs \nfrom the time-trended data from the previous location.\nThe bracket is aluminum and the magnet insert is samarium-cobalt.\nContinued on page 13\nInstallation InstructionsChapter 3 \n\nInstallation Instructions Wireless MultiHop Q45 3-Axis Vibration and Temperature Radios\n23-Sep-25 page 13 of 23© Banner Engineering Corp.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It is important to document the direction in which \neach axis is installed for labeling and diagnostic purposes.\nAn example install is to mount the sensor at the top center of a horizontally mounted motor with the X axis (parallel with the \nsensor cable) in line with the motor shaft or to mount the sensor with the Y axis (perpendicular to the sensor cable) \nperpendicular to the shaft in the horizontal radial axis and the Z axis (through plane of the sensor) going into or through the \nmotor in the vertical radial axis.\nFor the best results, install the sensor as close to the motor bearing as possible. If this is not possible, install the sensor on a \nsurface that is in rigid connection with the vibration characteristics of the motor.\nUsing a cover shroud or other flexible mounting location may result in a reduced accuracy or reduced ability to detect certain \nvibration characteristics. After determining the sensor direction and location, mount the sensor for the best possible vibration \nsensing accuracy.\nMounting Options QM30 Housing \nType Description\nBWA-QM30-FTAL (included \nwith the aluminum housing \nmodel)\nAluminum\nWhen available, directly mounting the bracket to the motor using an 1/4-28 × 1/2-inch screw \nprovides a rigid surface with the highest sensor accuracy and frequency response. This mounting \noption offers flexibility for future sensor and bracket movement.\nAnother mounting option is to use an epoxy to adhere the bracket to the motor. Banner recommends \nusing an epoxy designed for accelerometer mounting, such as Loctite Depend 330 and 7388 \nactivator.\nEpoxying a bracket to a motor provides a permanent installation of the bracket to which the sensor \ncan be attached. This more rigid mounting solution ensures some of the best sensor accuracy and \nfrequency response, but is not flexible for future adjustments.\nA third option is to use the included thermally conductive adhesive tape. This often provides a more \nthan sufficient mounting type but does introduce some additional flex that reduces accuracy.\nBWA-QM30-FTSS (included \nwith the stainless steel housing \nmodel)\nStainless steel\nBWA-QM30-CEAL (curved \nbracket epoxied to the motor) Aluminum\nThis lightweight aluminum bracket provides a close connection to the motor with ridges to sit on \ncurved surfaces and ensure a tight fit. The bracket is epoxied to the motor and the sensor is \nscrewed into the bracket.\nBWA-QM30-FMSS (flat magnet \nbracket)\nAluminum and \nstainless steel\nGives a solid, strong, and adjustable mount to a motor, but with a motor's curved surface it may not \nprovide the best connection if the motor is too small for the magnet to get a full connection with the \nmotor housing.\nMagnet mounts are susceptible to accident rotation or a change in the sensor location if an outside \nforce bumps or moves the sensor. This can lead to a change in sensor information that differs from \nthe time-trended data from the previous location.\nThe bracket is stainless steel and the magnet insert is neodymium.\nBWA-QM30-CMAL (curved \nsurface magnet bracket)\nAluminum and \nstainless steel\nGives a solid, strong, and adjustable mount to a motor, intended for use when the flat magnetic \nbracket does not make a good connection with the motor's surface.\nMagnet mounts are susceptible to accidental rotation or change in the sensor location if an outside \nforce bumps or moves the sensor. This can lead to a change in the sensor information that differs \nfrom the time-trended data from the previous location.\nThe bracket is aluminum and the magnet insert is samarium-cobalt.\nContinued on page 13\nInstallation InstructionsChapter 3 \n\nInstallation Instructions Wireless MultiHop Q45 3-Axis Vibration and Temperature Radios\n23-Sep-25 page 13 of 23© Banner Engineering Corp.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Alex<|#|>person<|#|>Alex is a character who experiences frustration and is observant of the dynamics among other characters.\nentity<|#|>Taylor<|#|>person<|#|>Taylor is portrayed with authoritarian certainty and shows a moment of reverence towards a device, indicating a change in perspective.\nentity<|#|>Jordan<|#|>person<|#|>Jordan shares a commitment to discovery and has a significant interaction with Taylor regarding a device.\nentity<|#|>Cruz<|#|>person<|#|>Cruz is associated with a vision of control and order, influencing the dynamics among other characters.\nentity<|#|>The Device<|#|>equipment<|#|>The Device is central to the story, with potential game-changing implications, and is revered by Taylor.\nrelation<|#|>Alex<|#|>Taylor<|#|>power dynamics, observation<|#|>Alex observes Taylor's authoritarian behavior and notes changes in Taylor's attitude toward the device.\nrelation<|#|>Alex<|#|>Jordan<|#|>shared goals, rebellion<|#|>Alex and Jordan share a commitment to discovery, which contrasts with Cruz's vision.)\nrelation<|#|>Taylor<|#|>Jordan<|#|>conflict resolution, mutual respect<|#|>Taylor and Jordan interact directly regarding the device, leading to a moment of mutual respect and an uneasy truce.\nrelation<|#|>Jordan<|#|>Cruz<|#|>ideological conflict, rebellion<|#|>Jordan's commitment to discovery is in rebellion against Cruz's vision of control and order.\nrelation<|#|>Taylor<|#|>The Device<|#|>reverence, technological significance<|#|>Taylor shows reverence towards the device, indicating its importance and potential impact.\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nStock markets faced a sharp downturn today as tech giants saw significant declines, with the global tech index dropping by 3.4% in midday trading. Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks

The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n4.  **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n5.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or additional text before or after the list.\n6.  **Completion Signal:** Output `<|COMPLETE|>` as the final line after all relevant missing or corrected entities and relationships have been extracted and presented.\n7.  **Output Language:** Ensure the output language is English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.
